Check ID Card with Machine Learning

This project is a web-based application that allows users to upload ID card images and compare them against a stored original image to detect tampering. The application uses Python, Django, OpenCV, and Machine Learning techniques to process and compare the images, highlighting differences using the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).
